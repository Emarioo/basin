# 1. Introduction
The Basin programming language is a complete rewrite of BetterThanBatch, an experimental language and compiler.

The Basin language is inspired by Jai, Odin, C, Rust.

The Goal of Basin is:
- Fast and simple to compile. 1 million lines per second (with multithreading).
- A straight forward type system.
- More similar to C than Rust.
- Meant for software where safety and security is not critical.
- Execute basin programs
- Compile basin programs (to libraries and object files)
- Compile and distribute basin programs (executables)

# 2. Programs and Source Code

A Basin program begins from one initial source file. From there files can be imported, libraries to link with can be specified, and compiler options can be set inside the Basin language. This means that codebases using Basin alone will usually not use a separate build system such as Make, CMake, or Premake.

The conventional file extension for basin source files is `.bsn`.

A basin program can be executed directly but can also produce executables to run and distribute. The entry point for programs will be the top-level expression in the initial source file. If a function is marked with `@entrypoint` then that function (such as `main`) will be the entry point. This allows you to have the entry point in a different file than the initial source file. It also means you have access to `argc` and `argv` you would get from `main` in a C program.

A program can also be compiled as an object file or library in which case global variables and functions can be exported and visible to programs using the library. Functions not exported will not have symbols. Exported and external functions will automatically use the operating system's calling convention rather than Basin's.

The compiler supports these object file and executable formats: COFF (windows), ELF (linux), DWARF (gdb, MinGW on windows).

To allow multiple return values, Basin uses its own calling convention which is very similar to System V ABI. See [Basin Calling Convention] for more information.

When compiling intermediate files such as inline assembly and object files they will be placed in the `bin/int` directory. Executables, static and dynamic libraries will be placed in `bin` directly.

**NOTE**: There are plans to support .PDB which is debug information for Windows.

# 3. Lexical Structure
The lexical structure of Basin program defines the text encoding and which characters are allowed.

Basin source files should be encoded using UTF-8.

Lexical analysis is applied to a file where sequences of characters are converted to tokens. These are the tokens:
## Identifiers
Identifiers are names for variables, functions, and parameters. They start with a letter or underscore followed by letters, digits, and underscores. The allowed characters for letters are the English characters A-Z. Identifiers are sensitive to lower and upper case.

**Examples:**
- `myvar`
- `_secret`
- `_123_hey`
- `gold` and `Gold` are different identifiers.
- `41kopwa` not allowed
- `4_23` not allowed
- `char_Ã¤` not allowed

## Keywords
Keywords are reserved identifiers.

Some are: `if`, `while`, `import`, `return`.

See `TokenKind` in [lexer.h](/src/basin/core/lexer.h).

(**TODO:** Once compiler implementation is more complete the full list will be put here)

## Literals
There are literal numbers, strings, characters, and booleans. They have specific values.

**Literal numbers:**
- `123`
- `12.244`
- `12.244e5` same as (12.244 * pow(10, 5))
- `0x123` hexidecimal
- `0o7267` octal
- `0b10011` binary

**Literal characters**
- `'a'` 
- `'\0'` 
- `'\n'`

**Literal strings**
- `"hello"`
- `"\"hello\""`
- `"'hello' is here"`
- `"hello\nhello2`

## Special characters
Operators and delimiters:
```
+-*/=^&<>~!
#
()[]{}
,.
```

## Whitespace
Whitespace is mostly ignored except for a few instances described in [Syntax](/docs/language/Basin%20Language%20Specification.md#4.%20Syntax).

## Comments
```
// one line
/*
   multi-line
*/
```

# 4. Syntax

The primitive component of a Basin program is the expression. The file is one big block expression with multiple expressions inside it.

```
file := block_expression

block_expression :=
